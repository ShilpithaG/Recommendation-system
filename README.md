 Team Member Replacement Recommendation System
The Team Performance Optimization project uses graph kernels to assess team compatibility and facilitate finding substitutes for critical members. Through data analysis and role-specific criteria, it enhances the overall team performance.
This project introduces a recommendation system for team member replacement inspired by Liangyue Li et al.'s research on fast algorithms for team member recommendation. Leveraging machine learning techniques, including graph kernels, the system suggests optimal team configurations based on skill matching and structural compatibility. Experimental evaluations using NBA data demonstrate the system's effectiveness and efficiency. The proposed algorithms offer a comprehensive solution for identifying suitable replacements, ensuring team performance and continuity.
